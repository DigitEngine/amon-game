      <p>The backstory is fairly simple. I (the creator) added
      a floating Amon. Then, I gave the floating Amon control
      using the arrow keys. Simple enough; however, I needed to
      add an objective. Sure, the Amon could move, but what
      inspired them to move. So I added the tennis ball. At first,
      the tennis ball was static, and aloof. It was not affected
      by anything. It would float midair, and the Amon could hit
      it, but it would stay static. So I added the force of
      gravity to the tennis ball. Then I decided that the game
      should end when the ball hits the ground. So I did that.
